# HALEM-PEGASIS Evaluator

> A simulation and evaluation tool for comparing the standard PEGASIS protocol with the novel HALEM-PEGASIS protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Developed in Java with a Swing-based GUI.

## üìå About the Project

This tool allows users to simulate and analyze two routing protocols for WSNs:

1. **PEGASIS (Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System)** ‚Äì a chain-based protocol that minimizes energy use by forming a chain of sensor nodes.
2. **HALEM-PEGASIS** ‚Äì a novel enhancement of PEGASIS incorporating:
   - **Hierarchical multi-chain formation**
   - **Adaptive leader selection using residual energy & centrality**
   - **Latency-energy tradeoff handling for QoS**
   - **Support for mobile sinks**
   - **Dynamic load balancing**

The tool offers an interactive simulation platform where protocol behaviors can be observed, measured, and compared under various WSN configurations.
